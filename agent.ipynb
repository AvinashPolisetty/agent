       "\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out the capital of France. Hmm, let me think. I remember that France is a country in Europe. I think the capital might be Paris. I've heard of Paris a lot, like the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum. But wait, could it be another city? Maybe Lyon or Marseille? No, I think those are major cities but not capitals. Let me try to recall. The capital is usually where the government is based. I'm pretty sure the French government is in Paris. Also, when people talk about the capital of fashion or art, they mention Paris. So it's probably Paris. But just to be safe, maybe I should double-check. I've heard of other capitals like Berlin for Germany, Rome for Italy, Madrid for Spain, so France's capital should be similar in prominence. Yeah, Paris makes sense. I think that's right.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe capital of France is **Paris**. It is not only the political and administrative center of the country but also renowned worldwide for its cultural landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Paris serves as the seat of the French government and is a major hub for art, fashion, and global influence. \\n\\n**Answer:** The capital of France is Paris.\""
